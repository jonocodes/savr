                <li>Article fetching from local content server</li>
                <li>HTML parsing and content extraction</li>
                <li>Metadata extraction (title, author, date)</li>
                <li>Storage in IndexedDB</li>
                <li>Synchronization with RemoteStorage</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>The Savr application uses several technologies to handle article ingestion:</p>

            <h3>Frontend Stack</h3>
            <p>React with TypeScript provides the user interface, while Material-UI offers consistent styling across components.</p>

            <h3>Storage Layer</h3>
            <p>Articles are stored locally using IndexedDB via the Dexie library. This allows for offline access and fast retrieval of saved articles.</p>

            <h3>Sync Mechanism</h3>
            <p>RemoteStorage.js handles synchronization between devices, ensuring that articles saved on one device appear on all connected devices.</p>
